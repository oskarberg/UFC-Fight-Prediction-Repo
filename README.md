# UFC_Fight_Prediction_Model


**Status:** Work in Progress

**Project Overview:** This repository is dedicated to developing a model for predicting UFC fight outcomes. The main components of the project right now include:

1. **Data Scraping:** Raw data is sourced directly from ufcstats.com using the script `MainScrape.py`.
2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** After scraping, the data undergoes preprocessing and feature engineering in `FeatureEngineering.py` to extract meaningful insights and prepare it for modeling.
3. **Cluster Visualization:** At the end of `FeatureEngineering.py`, an exploratory cluster visualization using  is done to explore if fighter style categorization is possible

**Next step** is to leverage this data to build a UFC fight prediction model with logistic regression.
